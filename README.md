# Minimal-Pair-Quiz
This project is designed to help learners distinguish words that may sound similar. For example: "right" and "light", "walk" and "woke"

The overal goal is to use this website to test and practise pronunciation. If the learner is able to hear and distinguish 100% of the words in each set, the next step would be to work on pronouncing the differences. That may be a future project to work on.

## How to use 

Go to this page: https://rhysmcg.github.io/Minimal-Pair-Quiz/ and then choose a set.

## To do list

Collecting
* Images from Irasutoya
* Recordings of words
* Perhaps remove TTS service alltogether? Causing more hassle and not as consistant 

Load the images smoothly 
* Set to blank, fade out, switch image, fade in

Think about a scoreboard or account system
* When a set is selected, start a timer and at the end stop it
* At the results page, 
* If you complete a set with a 100% score, a green âœ” appears 
* Record the score
